        - title: Authentic Korean Flavors at Wooga Jjajang
          date: 01 June 2024
          announcement: Last week, I enjoyed an amazing meal at Wooga Jjajang. This hidden
            gem in Clementi West offers authentic Korean-Chinese cuisine. The
            Jjajangmyeon was perfectly savoury, and the crispy Tangsuyuk was a
            delightful treat. If you’re craving authentic Korean flavours, Wooga
            Jjajang is a must-visit!
